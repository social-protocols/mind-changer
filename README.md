# Mind-changer

*very early-stage*

An attempt to measure change of mind (change of voting behavior) of a group of people caused by a single post. As a dataset we use the [Twitter Community Notes Dataset](https://communitynotes.x.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/download-data).

The basic idea is to generate some comparable mental-model representation from a user-item-vote matrix.
